# youtube-playlists-follow-up

The repository is an application that helps you keep track of the evolution of the elements of your playlists. 


If a video of your playlist has been removed from YouTube by its owner or by YouTube itself, this application will keep the relevant information about this video so that you can find a similar one on YouTube to restore your playlist.

If you had a video in your playlist that you removed and you want to restore your playlist adding back this video, this application will help you with this.
